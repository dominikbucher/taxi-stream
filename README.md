# Taxistream Generator

This program uses taxi data from New York to create (half-simulated) data streams.

## Various

* It seems the taxi data **does not contain** lat/lon after June 2016. So probably better to use data from before, as this
is a hypothetical example anyways.
* Other interesting repositories and blogs:
